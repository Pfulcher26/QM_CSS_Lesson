## Introduction: HTML, JavaScript, and CSS 

When building a website, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS work together like the body’s structure. Here's a simple way to think about their roles:

- **HTML** is like the bones of the body. It provides the essential structure and framework of a web page—without HTML, there's nothing to build upon.
- **JavaScript** is like the muscles. It moves the body and makes things interactive. With JavaScript, we can manipulate the structure, add functionality, and make the website dynamic.
- **CSS** is like the skin. It covers the bones, adds color, texture, and visual appeal, making everything look good and presentable to the user.

By working together, these three languages bring a website to life!

## What is CSS?

CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used in web development to define the look and feel of a web page. By styling HTML elements, CSS allows developers to create visually appealing layouts, control colors, fonts, spacing, and more.

### Key Elements of CSS:
- **Class** (`.classname`): Targets one or multiple elements with the same class name.
- **ID** (`#idname`): Targets a unique element with a specific ID.
- **Data Attributes** (`[data-*="value"]`): Custom attributes that store extra information on elements without affecting HTML structure.

## What is a CSS Selector?

A CSS selector is a pattern used to target HTML elements for styling or scripting. Selectors specify which elements in the document tree a CSS rule applies to. They are essential for any styling or element-targeting task in CSS or JavaScript.

### Types of CSS Selectors:
- **Simple Selectors**: Target elements by type, class, or ID (e.g., `p`, `.classname`, `#idname`).
- **Pseudo-Classes**: Target elements in a specific state (e.g., `:hover`, `:first-child`).
- **Attribute Selectors**: Target elements with specific attributes (e.g., `[type="text"]`, `[data-role="button"]`).
- **Combinator Selectors**: Target elements based on their relationship (e.g., `.parent .child`, `.sibling + .adjacent`).

## Why Data Attributes Are Important for Dynamically Generated CSS

Data attributes are essential for sites that use dynamically generated CSS because they provide a reliable way to target and interact with elements regardless of changing class names or IDs. When CSS is dynamically created or updated—such as during user interactions or content changes—data attributes remain static, ensuring elements can still be targeted by JavaScript and CSS selectors. This separation of concerns helps maintain clean code and improves performance.

## Targeting CSS in Stylesheets vs. querySelector

While CSS stylesheets and the `querySelector` method both use CSS selectors to target elements on a web page, they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts.

### CSS Stylesheets:
- CSS selectors in stylesheets are used to define the visual appearance of elements across a webpage. Once a page is loaded, the CSS rules are applied to all matching elements automatically, without requiring JavaScript intervention.
- CSS selectors in stylesheets typically target elements globally, meaning they apply to all elements matching the specified pattern (e.g., all `<p>` tags or elements with a specific class).

### querySelector in JavaScript:
- The `querySelector` method, on the other hand, is used to select individual elements dynamically within JavaScript code, often to manipulate the selected elements (e.g., change styles, add event listeners, or retrieve values).
- `querySelector` is more flexible in that it can target specific elements at runtime based on the document’s state. For example, you can use `querySelector` to select the first button clicked by a user or a specific item in a list after an interaction.

## Live Example

Let's use [Tofugu](https://www.tofugu.com/) to understand how we can use query seletor to target different web page elements using CSS. Open the Developer Tools (right-click > Inspect or press F12), and try selecting different elements on the page. Observe how CSS selectors are used to target elements for styling and structure.

### Try it:
- Visit [Tofugu](https://www.tofugu.com/).
- Use the Element Selector in Developer Tools to inspect an element, such as the navigation menu or article headings.
- Copy the CSS selector path and see how it highlights similar elements on the page.

## How Quantum Metric Uses CSS Selectors

### Events
Quantum Metric can trigger events based on CSS selectors.  These are often used for click events, selector present events and when writing custom Javascript events. 

### PII Remediation
CSS selectors help isolate and remediate PII (Personally Identifiable Information) by selecting specific input fields or data points on the page and anonymizing them.

### Zones
In Quantum Metric, "zones" refer to specific areas of a webpage where analytics events are triggered. By using CSS selectors, you can target specific areas of the page to define and track user interactions more precisely.

### Segments/Metrics

## CSS Cheat Sheet for querySelector

Below is a quick reference to some of the most commonly used CSS selectors, specifically for use with `querySelector` in JavaScript.

### Common CSS Selectors for querySelector
- **Universal Selector** (`*`): Targets all elements.
  ```javascript
  document.querySelector('*'); // Selects the first element on the page

- **Type Selector** (`element`): Targets all instances of a specific element.
  ```javascript
  document.querySelector('p'); // Selects the first <p> element

- **Class Selector** (`.classname`): Targets elements with a specific class.
  ```javascript
  document.querySelector('.header'); // Selects the first element with the class 'header'

---

## Combinator Selectors and the `>` Symbol

The `>` (child combinator) selector targets direct child elements of a specified parent element. This is useful when you want to select elements that are immediate children of a given element, excluding deeper nested elements.

### Direct Child Selector (`>`): Selects direct children of a parent element.

```javascript
document.querySelector('.parent > .child'); // Selects the first .child element that is a direct child of .parent
```

In this example, .child must be a direct child of .parent. If .child is nested deeper inside another element within .parent, it will not be selected.

***Example:***

```html
<div class="parent">
  <div class="child"></div> <!-- This will be selected -->
  <div>
    <div class="child"></div> <!-- This will NOT be selected -->
  </div>
</div>
```

### Combinations with Other Selectors

You can combine the `>` selector with other selectors for more specific targeting.

```javascript
document.querySelector('.parent > .child:nth-child(2)'); // Selects the second .child that is a direct child of .parent

```
